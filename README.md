My First Portfolio

This is my first personal portfolio website, created to showcase my work, skills, and projects. It features a clean, responsive design built with HTML, CSS. The portfolio includes sections for an introduction, my resume, and detailed project showcases with links to my GitHub repositories. The goal of this portfolio is to present my web development journey and provide potential employers and collaborators with a glimpse into my abilities, passion, and future goals. The site is designed with a focus on simplicity, user experience, and ease of navigation.
